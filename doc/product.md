# Product Description Schema

## Use case

A product description contains information about the device, its supported functional profiles, and how
the datapoints of the functional profiles can be accessed through the transport layer.

This allows potential controllers to easily integrate, implement, or access any SmartGridready certified product
through a standardized set of functionality, and thereby greatly simplifies scale-up to support a wide range of products.

## General Structure
The schema of the product description is structured on three levels:
- Device information concerning manufacturer and product data, and the basic configuration of the transport layer
- A list of supported functional profiles
- A list of data points (as defined in the respective functional profile definition) together with transport layer details on how to access the individual data point

The figure below shows the entity relation model of the product description.
