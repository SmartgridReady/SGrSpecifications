# Product Description Schema

## Use case

A product description contains information about the device, its supported functional profiles, and how
the datapoints of the functional profiles can be accessed through the transport layer.

This allows potential controllers to easily integrate, implement, or access any SmartGridready certified product
through a standardized set of functionality, and thereby greatly simplifies scale-up to support a wide range of products.

## General Structure
The schema of the product description is structured on three levels:
- Device information concerning manufacturer and product data, and the basic configuration of the transport layer
- A list of supported functional profiles
- A list of data points (as defined in the respective functional profile definition) together with transport layer details on how to access the individual data point

The figure below shows the entity relation model of the product description.

# Device Elements

### Release Notes
The release note section contains meta data that describe history and current state of the functional profile

| Element   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| state     | One of Draft, Review, Released, Revoked |
| remarks   | Optional, arbitrary text. Can be useful e.g. during draft phase. |
| changeLog | Optional, can occurs multiple times. Contains release notes to the version concerned |

### Device Information
| Element          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Name             | Device Name |
| Manufacturer     | Manufacturer |
| specificationOwnerIdentification | Owner of the declaration (normally identical to manufacturer, but different for 3rd party declarations) |
| Type             | local or cloud device |
| DeviceCategory   | Device Category |
| SoftwareRevision | Software revision of device |


### Device Attributes

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| levelOfOperation | Level of control defining the complexity (see [LevelOfOperation](LevelOfOperation.md) ), and is defined by the highest level of the devices functional profile |
| versionNumber | Version number of the Product Description (EID) - first two parts should be the same as in the file name |

### Descriptions
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| alternativeNames  | A list of relevant namespaces list for to display names used in different standards like EEBUS, IEC6850,, SAREF4ENER etc. (see [AlternativeNames](AlternativeNames.md))|
| legibleDescription | Optional, can occur once per language. Contains details concerning the intended use case of the functional profile. |

### Transport Service
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| transportService | One of Generic|Contacts|Modbus|RESTfulJSON |

Depending on the type of root element a transport-service specific structure is present, describing the device-specific transport-service configuration

## Functional Profiles
Each device contains a list of functional profiles.
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| profileName | Instance name of the functional profile entry - a device can include a specific functional profile more than once but with different profile instance names |
| functionalProfile | Copy of the standardized [functional profile](functionalProfile.md) |
| programmerHints   | optional, can occur once per language. Contains details for the programmer. |


## Data Points
Each functional profile instance contains a list of data points in accordance with the standardized functional profile.
| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Data point | Data point of the standardized [functional profile](functionalProfile.md), containing name, description, units, data type, read/write information |
| Interface Info| transport-service specific information on how to access the data point |
| programmerHints   | optional, can occur once per language. Contains details for the programmer. |

### Constant Data Points

Additional to the datapoints in the functional profile the product has the concept of constant datapoints that can implement the datapoint of the functional profile and that have a constant value.

For this, the data direction "C" is possible in products. In this case, a value must be defined for the datapoint.

### Generic Attributes
SGr allows to associate attributes to a data point. See [GenericAttributes](GenericAttributes.md) for details.

The generic attributes (see [GenericAttributes](GenericAttributes.md)) contain static characteristics of the product.

The generic attributes are a list of elements defined by

- name
- data type
- value
- description

## File Naming Schema
File names for Products Definitions (EID's) should have the following file naming conventions:

`SGr_[LevelOfOperation]_[ManufacturerId]_[DesclarationId]_[Manufacturer]_[ProductName]_V[PrimaryVerion].[SecondaryVerion].xml`

with

- `LevelOfOperation`: As defined in [LevelOfOperation](LevelOfOperation.md) with 2 digits without `m` and with leading `0`
- `ManufacturerId`: Maintained by the declaration office - `mmmm` if not yet known
- `DesclarationId`: Maintained by the declaration office - `dddd` if not yet known
- `Manufacturer`: Manufacturer name - short - if possible only one word
- `ProductName`: Product name - short - if possible only one word
- `PrimaryVerion` / `SecondaryVerion`: First two parts of the version of the Product Definitions (EID's) - same as [versionNumber](product.md#device-attributes)

If there are more Product Definitions for one product with different interfaces, the interface can optionally be added as `Interface` with values `RestAPI`, `MQTT`, `Modbus`, `ModbusRTU`, `ModbusTCP`, ...

`SGr_[LevelOfOperation]_[ManufacturerId]_[DesclarationId]_[Manufacturer]_[ProductName]_[Interface]_V[PrimaryVerion].[SecondaryVerion].xml`
